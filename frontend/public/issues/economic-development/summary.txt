Affordable housing plays a pivotal role in the overall economic development of Brookline. When housing is affordable, it allows for a broader range of workers—teachers, healthcare workers, service industry employees—to live in the community and contribute to the local economy. Without affordable housing, the rising costs of living push out these key members of our workforce, making it harder for small businesses and local services to thrive. Focusing on policies that foster inclusive, mixed-income communities will help support a more diverse economy by ensuring that residents of all economic backgrounds can participate in economic growth. Housing is not just a necessity but a key to enabling people to contribute to the local economy and improve Brookline’s overall prosperity.
