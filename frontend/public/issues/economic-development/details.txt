Our commercial districts are an essential and cherished part of our Brookline community. Residents want these areas to be vibrant hubs, combining retail, restaurant spaces, offices, services, public art, and cultural destinations.

One of the best ways to support our local businesses is by promoting walkable, multi-family, mixed-income and mixed-use housing, most particularly in our commercial districts and transit corridors.

Brookline is a fantastic place to live, have a family, and build an amazing network of friends and business partners, but our economic ecosystem has reached its limit. Where we build our homes and how we live in them are critical to strengthening Brookline’s ability to:

<ol>
    <li>Support climate sustainability
    <li>Increase the town’s tax base
    <li>Enhance our walkable neighborhoods
    <li>Foster equity and inclusion
</ol>

People—not property—are the foundation of long-term economic success. To create this thriving economic ecosystem that we envision, Brookline needs more homes for people at all income levels. Our businesses will thrive when their workers and customers live within walking distance or just a short bus or Green Line ride away. This will allow residents easy access to jobs, schools, services, and the vibrant community life that attracts people to Brookline.

A weak commercial tax base forces Brookline to rely on continually raising residential property taxes, leading to regular overrides. Under our current and previous leadership, Brookline has restricted development along its commercial and mixed-use corridors. Zoning changes in the last decades of the 20th century made it more difficult to build 3- to 5-story buildings. Large, underutilized commercial properties with low tax contributions are common, and Brookline’s commercial tax rates are higher than those in peer communities. With high rents and limited development, it’s hard for Brookline’s businesses to thrive.
