Brookline’s fiscal instability is of growing concern. As a team, if elected, we aim to prioritize a comprehensive review of our budget to ensure that we are maximizing efficiency and making strategic investments. This means looking at ways to reduce wasteful spending while also ensuring that critical areas such as affordable housing, education, and climate resilience are adequately funded.
We also advocate for exploring new revenue sources, including leveraging Brookline’s economic development potential through zoning adjustments for mixed-use development and commercial growth in underutilized areas. This approach can generate sustainable income for the town while minimizing the financial burden on residents. It’s also essential to explore partnerships with local businesses, nonprofits, and other entities to fund projects that benefit the community, ensuring that Brookline’s fiscal health is secure in both the short and long term.
