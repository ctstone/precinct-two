The town is facing <a href="https://stories.opengov.com/brooklinema/bca92894-b103-49d7-9ffe-4cff983d5265/published/pWgvVpKym?currentPageId=65fb0aafec21f4d6f6c2a889">several challenges in FY2026</a>, including rising healthcare costs, collective bargaining pressures, and a <a href="https://stories.opengov.com/brooklinema/bca92894-b103-49d7-9ffe-4cff983d5265/published/pWgvVpKym?currentPageId=65fb0aaf3b9829ac866c5c0f">significant budget gap within the Public Schools of Brookline (PSB)</a>, which is expected to reach $8.2 million for FY 2026. While the town is seeing some growth in revenue, including modest increases in property taxes and state aid, the cost of maintaining municipal services and funding education continues to rise and presents significant barriers for our residents.

The town has relied on a <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/3590/FY2024-26-Override-Central">property tax override approved in May 2023</a> to prevent major cuts to services in the short term. However, this override ends in FY 2026, and ongoing structural budget deficits remain, especially within the school budget. To address these gaps, the town is pursuing efficiency measures, potential cuts, and exploring new revenue sources. Long-term financial planning is a priority as Brookline works toward creating a sustainable budget model that doesn’t rely solely on overrides. Increasing housing availability will be a key resource in alleviating this fiscal burden.

The impact of federal funding uncertainties, particularly the risk of losing key grants is also of acute concern. In response, Brookline is preparing to defend its rights and adjust operations if necessary. Meanwhile, funding from federal programs such as the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319">American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)</a> and the <a href="https://www.communitypreservation.org/about">Community Preservation Act (CPA)</a> is being used for specific projects, including affordable housing and infrastructure improvements.

Everything—from the <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/851/Budget-Central">Town Budget</a> to education, transportation, DEAI efforts, and environmental sustainability—is inextricably linked to Brookline's housing needs. According to the Economic Development Advisory Board and the Economic Development and Long-Term Planning division of the Brookline Planning Department, mixed-use development near transit is essential for increasing the Town’s revenue. We’re running for Brookline Town Meeting Because we are fighting for Brookline to thrive as a community. To do that, we must prioritize creating more homes of all types. With over 70 percent of Brookline’s revenue coming from property taxes, increasing the housing supply will spread the tax base across more properties and relieve financial pressure on our current residents, neighbors, and friends.
