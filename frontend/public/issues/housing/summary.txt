The housing issue in Brookline is central to addressing the critical challenges we face. Everything—from the Town Budget to education, transportation, DEAI efforts, and environmental sustainability—are all inextricably linked to our housing needs. According to the Economic Development Advisory Board and the Economic Development and Long-Term Planning division of the Brookline Planning Department, mixed-use development near transit is the best path to increasing the Town’s revenue. To thrive as a community, we must prioritize creating more homes of all types. With over 70 percent of Brookline’s revenue coming from property taxes, increasing the housing supply will spread the tax base across more properties and relieve financial pressure on current residents.

We, alongside our endorsement partners, advocate for a more integrated approach to housing that promotes the inclusion of residents from diverse backgrounds by prioritizing mixed-use developments near transit hubs. This would ensure equal access to essential resources, reduce reliance on cars, and lower associated costs. Not only would this approach support the affordability of living in Brookline, but it would also help mitigate climate change by reducing emissions.
