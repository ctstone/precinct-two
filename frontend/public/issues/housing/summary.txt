Resolving the conflicts between housing density, affordability, sustainability, and preserving Brookline’s historic buildings and neighborhood character is one of our town’s greatest challenges. Housing costs in Brookline are prohibitively high, creating significant barriers to inclusivity. As a result, more families, seniors, teachers, and municipal employees are being pushed out of our community, while Brookline increasingly becomes a community for the ultra-wealthy. The lack of middle-income housing is a key factor in this exclusionary trend, further compounded by zoning restrictions and excessive regulations.
We, alongside our endorsement partners, advocate for a more integrated approach to housing that promotes the inclusion of residents from diverse backgrounds by prioritizing mixed-use developments near transit hubs. This would ensure equal access to essential resources, reduce reliance on cars, and lower associated costs. Not only would this approach support the affordability of living in Brookline, but it would also help mitigate climate change by reducing emissions.
