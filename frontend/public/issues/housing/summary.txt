The housing challenge in Brookline is fundamental to tackling the broader issues facing our community.
From the Town Budget to education, transportation, <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/545/Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-Community-Rel">DEAI initiatives</a>, and sustainability, our housing needs are at the heart of all of it.
According to the <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/493/Economic-Development-Advisory-Board">Economic Development Advisory Board</a> and the <a href="https://www.brooklinema.gov/directory.aspx?did=16">Economic Development and Long-Term Planning division of the Brookline Planning Department</a>, developing mixed-use spaces near transit hubs is the most effective way to boost the town’s revenue.
In order to thrive as a community, we must focus on increasing housing availability for all types of residents.
With property taxes accounting for over 70 percent of Brookline’s revenue, expanding the housing supply will distribute the tax burden across more properties, easing the financial pressure on existing homeowners and renters.

As your 2025, Precinct 2 Slate, we support this approach to housing growth.
However, we oppose any efforts to reduce or eliminate single-family zoning.
Part of what makes Brookline’s architectural heritage so extraordinary is the beauty of our single-family neighborhoods and their surrounding green-spaces and tree canopies.
We are dedicated to safeguarding these unique, urban benefits for generations to come.

Based on the evidence, we believe that this strategy not only promotes long-term affordability but also reduces reliance on cars, helps lower associated costs, and fosters inclusivity by welcoming new neighbors.
By expanding housing options, we strengthen our community, reduce environmental impact, and make Brookline a more sustainable place to live.
