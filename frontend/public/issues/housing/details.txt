Resolving the conflicts between housing density, affordability, sustainability, and preserving Brookline’s historic buildings and neighborhood character is one of our town’s greatest challenges. Housing costs in Brookline are prohibitively high, creating significant barriers to inclusivity. As a result, more families, seniors, teachers, and municipal employees are being pushed out of our community, while Brookline increasingly becomes a community for the ultra-wealthy. The lack of middle-income housing is a key factor in this exclusionary trend, further compounded by zoning restrictions and excessive regulations.

The housing issue in Brookline is central to addressing the critical challenges we face. Everything—from the Town Budget to education, transportation, DEAI efforts, and environmental sustainability—are all inextricably linked to our housing needs. According to the Economic Development Advisory Board and the Economic Development and Long-Term Planning division of the Brookline Planning Department, mixed-use development near transit is the best path to increasing the Town’s revenue. To thrive as a community, we must prioritize creating more homes of all types. With over 70 percent of Brookline’s revenue coming from property taxes, increasing the housing supply will spread the tax base across more properties and relieve financial pressure on current residents.

We, alongside our endorsement partners, advocate for a more integrated approach to housing that promotes the inclusion of residents from diverse backgrounds by prioritizing mixed-use developments near transit hubs. This would ensure equal access to essential resources, reduce reliance on cars, and lower associated costs. Not only would this approach support the affordability of living in Brookline, but it would also help mitigate climate change by reducing emissions.

        <b>Housing and Racial Justice</b>
        <p>Housing and Racial Justice: Housing and racial justice are deeply interconnected. Historical practices such as redlining and discriminatory zoning have disproportionately impacted communities of color, limiting access to affordable housing in different communities. To avoid perpetuating these disparities in our own community, we must ensure our housing policies actively foster inclusive, mixed-income neighborhoods where people from diverse social, cultural, racial, and economic backgrounds can live and thrive together.</p>
        <p>To do this, we believe that any new housing initiatives we consider must center equity by seamlessly integrating affordable housing into our existing neighborhoods. We can do this in three key ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>By encouraging density near transit hubs and essential services, we can prevent further displacement and segregation along racial and economic lines.</li>
            <li>By ensuring marginalized groups are equally represented in the decision-making process at the highest level of our town government and particularly, with regard to housing development.</li>
            <li>By creating necessary support infrastructures—such as equitable access to education and other crucial resources—so that new residents can seamlessly integrate into the community.</li>

        <b>Comprehensive Plan Study</b>
        <p>The Comprehensive Plan Study Committee and citizen-petitioned warrant articles serve different but complementary roles in shaping Brookline’s zoning policies and land use. The Comprehensive Plan Study Committee, as a slower-moving body, provides long-term, strategic guidance that reflects careful consideration of community goals and town values. Their focus is on ensuring that changes align with the broader vision for Brookline’s future, balancing competing interests in a sustainable way. However, our citizen-petitioned warrant articles provide more immediate, grassroots action, and are clear indicators of the ‘real-time’ shifting values and priorities of our residents and neighbors. They allow the community to voice urgent needs and concerns, particularly around housing affordability and density, which sometimes demand quicker responses than the longer-term deliberations of a committee that can sometimes slow or stymie the development process. It’s essential to take a collaborative approach, ensuring that the insights from community-driven warrant articles inform and, at times, even accelerate the work of the Comprehensive Plan Committee.</p>

        <b>Problem-Resolution</b>
        <p>We believe Brookline can strike a meaningful balance between providing much-needed affordable housing and maintaining the unique visual vernacular of Brookline's built environment. We can do this by considering density that complements the character of our neighborhoods, rather than overwhelming or fundamentally changing them. Zoning changes should incorporate strategies for adaptive reuse of historic buildings, preserving our cultural and architectural heritage while still allowing for growth and development. Mixed-use development and infill projects can also help increase density without disrupting the character of our neighborhoods, and we plan to support policies that will help Brookline do just that!</p>
