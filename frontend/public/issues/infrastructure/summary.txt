Along with our community partners, we envision Brookline as a vibrant, diverse, and welcoming place for everyone. “People, not property,” are the heart of Brookline’s long-term economic success and well-being. As we plan for our collective future, it’s important to recognize how closely environmental sustainability aligns with our housing and infrastructure needs, and policies. The way we build and operate our homes and utilize our thoroughfares contributes significantly to carbon emissions, so it’s essential to design energy-efficient, sustainable developments that will serve us for years to come. By incentivizing green building standards, integrating renewable energy, and ensuring climate resilience, we know we can create a more sustainable future together, for Brookline.
