Brookline is a great place to live for so many reasons—our convenient public transit connections, central location near Greater Boston’s world-renowned universities, hospitals, businesses, and cultural centers. But most of all, people are drawn to Brookline because of our exceptional school system and our commitment to educational excellence.
However, despite rising housing costs and taxes, the Public Schools of Brookline are facing significant budget cuts in an effort to fill a substantial funding gap, which is expected to reach $8.2 million for FY 2026. These cuts are fundamentally undercutting our valued educational system and are a disservice to our children and their futures.
If elected to Town Meeting, our slate will work together to explore new revenue sources to address this gap. This includes leveraging Brookline’s economic development potential by adjusting zoning for mixed-use development and encouraging commercial growth in underutilized areas. These efforts will help ensure our schools receive the funding necessary to maintain the standard of excellence, inclusivity, and accessibility that our public schools are known for.
