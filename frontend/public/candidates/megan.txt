I’ve called Brookline home for over 20 years—first as a renter in my 20s, right out of college, and now as a proud homeowner and newly-single mother of two. With a two-decade career as a teacher in the greater Boston area’s public schools, I’ve learned firsthand that being able to stay in Brookline shouldn’t be determined by financial privilege or marital status. My own experience as a middle-income resident has made me acutely aware of the anxieties my peers face when trying to secure stable, affordable housing here. In recent years, I’ve watched housing costs rise while the quality of education and support systems for our children has declined. I’m running for Town Meeting because I am committed to reversing these destabilizing trends through meaningful change, advocating for policies that support residents across all income levels.

As a candidate, I am focused on pushing for sustainable housing policies that help create a Brookline where everyone, regardless of background, can thrive and build a future in the community they treasure.
