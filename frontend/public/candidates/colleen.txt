Hi, my name is Colleen Newsome. I'm a former operations analyst and a mother of four children who attend the Public Schools of Brookline—from an incoming kindergartner at Lawrence to a graduating senior at Brookline High.

My family has greatly benefited from the many community programs Brookline offers—such as Steps to Success, BACE, and BREC. These programs, and the classes they provide, are so deeply woven into our public school experience that many parents may not realize they are independent organizations.

These programs are the hands that hold up students with after-school music lessons, tutoring, mentoring, and career guidance. I want to ensure that these essential resources remain available to families like mine, who depend on them.

Many in our community are now questioning whether they can stay in Brookline if the high cost of living is no longer matched by the quality educational programs that once drew them here. I believe we must find ways to generate the necessary revenue to fund these programs—through clean, modern, and efficient affordable housing initiatives.

If we keep Brookline closed to progress, we risk losing the very things we’ve worked so hard to build.

Please vote for me and my slate in P2 on May 6th! A vote for us is a vote to preserve the heart and soul of the Brookline community.
