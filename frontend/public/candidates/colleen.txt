I’m Colleen Newsome (she/her), a 40-year-old mother of four, all attending Brookline Public Schools. My family and I moved to Brookline five years ago, and since then, we’ve become deeply connected to the community. Programs like Steps to Success, BREC, and BACE have provided my children with invaluable opportunities—from music lessons to tutoring and summer camps—that they might not have had otherwise.

However, these programs are now being defunded, and many parents are concerned about the future of Brookline’s educational resources. I’m committed to preserving these opportunities, ensuring that all families, regardless of income, can access the same support that has benefited my children.

I excel at identifying inefficiencies and finding solutions. I am determined to make sure that Brookline doesn’t miss out on critical funding, as we did with the Healey-Driscoll Administration’s MBTA Communities Catalyst Fund, where we missed out on millions due to lack of planning.

As a proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I advocate for affordable housing, mixed-use developments, and sustainable practices that will strengthen Brookline’s future. A vote for me and my slate is a vote to protect the heart and soul of Brookline.
