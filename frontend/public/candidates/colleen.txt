I am a former operations analyst and an involved parent to four children within the public schools of Brookline. From a graduating senior, to an incoming kindergarten student. My family has personally benefited greatly from the incredible programs and supportive community that exists within our town and I want to ensure these programs continue to have the funding they need to enrich the lives of other students.
