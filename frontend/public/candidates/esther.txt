I am a community paramedic and passionate advocate for healthcare access and social equity. I have lived in Brookline with my wife for seven years and I’ve worked as a 911 paramedic for over a decade. I have served on ambulances throughout the greater Boston area, including working on Brookline’s dedicated town ambulances. In my current role as a community paramedic, I administer urgent care to patients in their homes, helping to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits. I work exclusively with Medicaid patients, a population whose health and social challenges are closely tied to housing. I strongly believe in the “housing first” healthcare model, recognizing that stable housing is vital to improving health outcomes.

My experiences on the frontlines of emergency healthcare have given me a deep understanding of the gaps in our housing, social services, and public safety systems. I’ve seen firsthand how the current ambulance contract misallocates resources to land rather than people, leading to poor patient outcomes, particularly in Precinct 2. I am committed to addressing these systemic issues and advocating for changes that prioritize the well-being of people, not land or property.

I’m running for Town Meeting to bring my knowledge of healthcare, public safety, and housing to the table, focusing on promoting racial equity, protecting social services, and tackling Brookline’s housing crisis.
