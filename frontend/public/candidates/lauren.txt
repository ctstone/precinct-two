I’ve had the privilege of calling Brookline home for the past 18 years.
I moved here to pursue graduate degrees in social work and public health, specializing in refugee mental health.
As a solo mom to a 3-year-old daughter and with older parents who recently moved to Brookline, I have a broad perspective on the strengths and challenges facing our community.
Encouraged by a friend and current Town Meeting Member, I felt compelled to run for Precinct 2 to represent that diversity of experience and contribute to sustainable, equitable change.
Working alongside the other women on this slate has been inspiring, as I’ve learned from their vast experience.
If elected, I will advocate for policies that prioritize affordable housing, a thriving public school system, and environmental sustainability.
