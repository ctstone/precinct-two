I have been very fortunate to call Brookline home for the past 18 years. I came to the area to pursue graduate degrees in social work and public health and have specialized in the field of refugee mental health. As a solo mom to a 3-year-old daughter with older parents who recently moved to Brookline, I have a broad perspective on the strengths and challenges impacting different sectors of our community. When a friend and current Town Meeting Member encouraged me to run in Precinct 2, I felt motivated to bring a voice to that diversity of experience and contribute to sustainable, strategic, and equitable progressive change. Since making the decision to run, I have been so inspired to work alongside the other women on this slate and learn about the breadth of experience and knowledge they would bring to Town Meeting. If elected, I will advocate for policies that center housing access and affordability, a thriving public school system, and environmental sustainability.
