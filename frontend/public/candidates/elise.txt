I believe that as a community, we can honor and preserve the beauty of our architectural landscape while embracing all the hope and vitality of a prosperous future. I’m running for Town Meeting because I believe Brookline needs thoughtful, inclusive leadership to address the important challenges ahead, particularly in the areas of housing, equity, education, and sustainability.
The rising cost of housing in Brookline has become a significant concern for many families and residents, making it harder for our beloved neighbors to find a place to call home. This affordability crisis creates dangerous barriers to equitable access to vital resources and undermines the diversity and inclusivity that make our town so special.
As a proud parent in the PSB system and someone with over 15 years of experience working to preserve the Boston area’s cultural and civic identity, I’m excited to bring my passion and experience to Brookline. I’m committed to understanding how current policies affect residents in areas like social services, healthcare, public safety, education, and transit. I want to ensure that everyone has equal access to these essential resources.
I believe our community should reflect the diversity of the world around us, and that all our children have the resources they need to grow, succeed, and contribute as they become adults.
If elected, I’ll work to foster open conversations and collaborate with others to find practical solutions that make Brookline more affordable, vibrant, and sustainable for everyone. I’m committed to supporting policies that protect our most vulnerable residents, prioritize affordable housing, and strengthen our local businesses. Together, we can make sure Brookline remains a place where all residents have the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.
