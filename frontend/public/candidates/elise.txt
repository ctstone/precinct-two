At its core, I believe responsible government leads with compassion and accountability. It builds trust through transparency, open dialogue, and collaborative problem-solving. It ensures policies align with our values, and addresses pressing challenges like housing affordability, education, and supporting local businesses. But, most of all, I believe responsible government recognizes when our choices are no-longer serving the majority, but rather, are benefiting the privileged few. To avoid this, we need equitable representation in our local government—I’ve chosen to run side-by-side with these incredible women because I’ve seen them in action—every day—making Brookline a safe, equitable, and affordable space for everyone. I hope you’ll support me—and indeed—all of us—as your 5 friends and neighbors who will bring you the much-needed change our community deserves.

Sense of ‘place’ and belonging are deeply rooted within all of us–Brookline is our collective place, we all call home.
