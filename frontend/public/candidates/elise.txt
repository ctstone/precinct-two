I believe that as a community, we can honor and preserve the beauty of our architectural landscape while embracing all the hope and vitality of a prosperous future. I’m running for Town Meeting because I believe Brookline needs inclusive leadership that prioritizes Precinct-2 residents, and not only responds to their evolving needs, but proactively supports policies that will protect our most vulnerable residents, prioritize sustainable growth, and strengthens our local businesses.
The rising cost of housing in Brookline has become a source of anxiety for many families, friends, and neighbors, making it harder for residents to find a place to call home. This affordability crisis creates dangerous barriers to equitable access to vital resources and undermines the diversity and inclusivity that makes our town so special.
As a proud parent in the PSB school-system and as a nearly 20-year resident, I believe our community should reflect the diversity of the world around us, and that all our children have the resources needed to grow, learn, and succeed. If elected, I’ll work to foster open conversations and collaborate with you, our neighbors!--to find practical solutions that make Brookline more affordable, vibrant, and sustainable for all of us.
