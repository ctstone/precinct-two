<b>As your 2025 Precinct 2 Slate, we understand that balancing housing density, affordability, sustainability, and the preservation of Brookline’s unique neighborhood character will be one of our greatest challenges ahead.</b>
Housing costs in Brookline are becoming prohibitively high, creating barriers to inclusivity.
More families, seniors, teachers, and municipal employees are being pushed out of our community, making Brookline a place where only the ultra-wealthy can afford to live.
The lack of middle-income housing is a major factor in this exclusionary trend, compounded by outdated zoning laws and excessive regulations.

<b>We advocate for an integrated approach to solving these challenges by welcoming new residents from all backgrounds and prioritizing mixed-use developments near transit hubs and commercial districts.</b>
This will strengthen our local economy, increase access to essential resources, reduce car dependency, and ease the financial pressure on current homeowners and renters.
It also helps lower emissions, contributing to a reduction in Brookline’s carbon footprint.

<b>However, we do not support initiatives that seek to eliminate or reduce single-family zoning laws.</b>
Rather, we believe Brookline’s architectural charm is rooted in the beauty of its single-family neighborhoods, tree-lined streets, and abundant green spaces.
We are committed to safeguarding these features and preserving the unique character of our neighborhoods for future generations.
