Meet <b>Esther</b>, <b>Lauren</b>, <b>Colleen</b>, <b>Elise</b>, and <b>Megan</b>! As your <b>Precinct 2 Slate</b>, we believe that responsible government means creating a community where every resident feels heard, valued, and supported.
We are running for the first time because we believe Brookline needs thoughtful, new voices who prioritize the well-being of <i>all</i> Brookline residents–regardless of income, background, or identity.
We want to contribute to  a Brookline where our children are able to raise their families near us, our seniors can age in place, and we welcome new neighbors.

<b>To achieve this, we will:</b>

<ul class="p2-list">
    <li>Support policies that ensure our schools receive the funding necessary to maintain the level of excellence we have come to expect from our neighborhood schools
    <li>Prioritize mixed-use and commercial development near transit on underutilized sites to boost Town revenue
    <li>Advocate for a comprehensive review of the Town budget to maximize efficiency and make strategic investments
    <li>Promote environmental sustainability and green space preservation
</ul>

<b>Brookline’s financial future depends on the choices we make today.</b>
Help us get Brookline back on track with affordable housing, education, fiscal responsibility – and so much more!
