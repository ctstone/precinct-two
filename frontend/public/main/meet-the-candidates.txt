Meet <b>Esther</b>, <b>Lauren</b>, <b>Colleen</b>, <b>Elise</b>, and <b>Megan</b>! As your <b>Precinct 2 Slate</b>, we recognize that responsible government means creating a community where every resident feels heard, valued, and supported.
We are running for the first time because we believe Brookline needs thoughtful, inclusive leadership who prioritize the well-being of all Brookline residents–regardless of income, background, or identity.
We want to contribute to a Brookline where our children can raise their families near us, our seniors can age in place, and we welcome new neighbors.

<b>To achieve this, we will:</b>

<ul class="p2-list">
    <li>Support policies that ensure our schools receive the funding necessary to maintain the level of excellence we have come to expect from our neighborhood schools
    <li>Promote more homes and commercial development near transit hubs to increase our tax base, and relieve the tax burden for our residents
    <li>Bolster environmental sustainability, stewardship, & green space preservation
    <li>Review the Town budget to find efficiencies while also supporting strategic investments that prioritize the well-being of all Brookline residents.
</ul>

<b>Brookline’s financial future depends on the choices we make today.</b>
Help us build a path to increasing housing affordability, raising revenue for our schools, and promoting fiscal responsibility, while also preserving the things we love most about Brookline.
