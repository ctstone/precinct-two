As your <b>2025 Precinct 2 Slate</b>, we believe that responsible government means creating a community where every resident feels heard, valued, and supported. For us, it’s about making thoughtful, well-informed decisions that prioritize the well-being of all Brookline residents—regardless of income, background, or identity. Responsible government isn’t just about reacting to issues as they arise, but planning proactively for a sustainable, inclusive, and equitable future. This includes balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, using resources wisely, and ensuring our most vulnerable neighbors are never left behind.
This is a mission-critical election—Brookline’s financial future depends on the choices we make today. Together, we will work to build an active, dynamic, and sustainable Brookline, where thriving businesses and homes for all incomes are seamlessly integrated with the natural environment.
<b>Brookline Town Elections are on Tuesday, May 6th</b>. Help us get Brookline back on track with housing, education, financial responsibility, and so much more!
