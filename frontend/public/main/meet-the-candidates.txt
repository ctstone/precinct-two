Meet Esther, Lauren, Colleen, Elise, and Meghan! As your <b>NEW Precinct 2 slate</b>, we believe that responsible government means creating a community where every resident feels heard, valued, and supported. We want a Brookline where our families, our children, and our grandchildren can grow and thrive.

For us, it’s about making thoughtful, well-informed decisions that prioritize the well-being of all Brookline residents—regardless of income, background, or identity.

To achieve this vision, we will:

<ul>
    <li>Support policies that ensure our schools receive the funding necessary to maintain the level of excellence we have come to expect from our neighborhood schools</li>
    <li>Prioritize mixed-use and commercial development near transit on underutilized sites to boost Town revenue and increase our diversity</li>
    <li>Advocate for a comprehensive review of the Town budget to maximize efficiency and make strategic investments</li>
    <li>Promote environmental sustainability and preserve our green spaces</li>
</ul>

<b>Town Elections are on Tuesday, May 6th</b>, and Brookline’s financial future depends on the choices we make this spring. Help us get Brookline back on track with affordable housing, education, fiscal responsibility, and so much more. <b>Vote New, Precinct 2! This May 6th</b>.
