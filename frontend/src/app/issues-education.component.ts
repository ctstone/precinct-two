    <h1>Education</h1>

    <p>The <a href="https://stories.opengov.com/brooklinema/bca92894-b103-49d7-9ffe-4cff983d5265/published/pWgvVpKym?currentPageId=65fb0aaf3b9829ac866c5c0f">Town/School Partnership</a>, which has been in place since 1995, plays a key role in Brookline’s annual financial planning process. The agreement ensures that the Town and Schools each receive 50% of the available revenue, after fixed costs are deducted, to fund their operations. Over time, adjustments have been made to accommodate rising enrollment, with more funding directed to the School side of the formula. Recent changes include allocating revenues from increases in the trash fee to the Town side, as these fees help cover the cost of new trash collection services.
    <p>The allocation of funds for the Town and School budgets is carefully planned. Non-departmental fixed costs are subtracted from the total revenue, and the remaining funds are divided according to the agreed-upon formula. Any necessary adjustments for savings, revenues, or shared expenses are then made to ensure fairness.
    <p>This system has provided stability and predictability to the budget process for nearly two decades. A projection of funds within the Town operating budget shows how resources are shared between the Town and the School Department, supporting activities like school crossing guards and playground maintenance.
    <p>The School Department continues to rely on these shared resources, and as the town faces increasing costs, it’s important to consider the balance between Town and School needs to ensure continued quality education and services.
